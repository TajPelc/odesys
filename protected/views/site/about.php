    <h2>A brief history</h2>
    <p>ODESYS was developed as a part of a diploma thesis by <em>Taj Pelc</em>, titled Web System For Multicriteria Decision Support (Spletni sistem za podporo odločanju) at the <a href="http://www.fov.uni-mb.si/en/" title="Faculty of organisational sciences">Faculty of organisational sciences</a> (FOV) in Kranj, Slovenia, under the mentorship of professor dr. Vladislav Rajkovič.</p>
    <p>The thesis falls under the context of the course Decision Support Systems and investigates the development of a web-based decision support system. To this end, we developed a unique decision support method based upon Abacon and Kepner-Tregoe methods and implemented it using the latest web technologies available.</p>
    <p>The result was ODESYS Alpha, a showcase project that proved, that developing a web based DSS offers quite some benefits over traditional software based DSS. Unlike similar software, web-based DSS require no installation or dependencies, administrator rights and are not limited by the operating system. They are accessible from any web capable device with a modern browser.</p>
    <p>After taking the diploma, development on an improved, production ready version, was started with the help of another student of FOV, <em>Frenk T. Sedmak Nahtigal</em>. In current form the DSS is limited to solving only non-complex decision problems with up to 10 one-level criteria and up to 10 alternatives, and without advanced analysis methods.</p>
    <p>ODESYS may be used in the pedagogical process as an introduction to multi-criteria decision support and decision support systems.</p>
    <p>As of October 2010, a future development strategy is yet to be devised, but we will continue to supported the project.</p>
